# HackerHunt
Do you have a sideproject you could use some help with? Or maybe you have the skill and want to collaborate on an existing project! If you're any of these two, HackerHunt is for you. It's a platform to connect collaborators with projects. 

This is NOT meant to be used for paid work. HackerHunt is targeting college students to want to learn new tech together.
